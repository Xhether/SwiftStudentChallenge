Hello! This is a work in progress project that I'm planning on working on until later the end of this month at the very least,
I also want to submit this project to the 2024 Swift Student Challenge. 

StuDone (name pending haha) is a task manager that will allow for increased accessibility and support friends and goal tracking 
in order to increase accountability between people working in groups, and encourage people to follow their habits and goals
that are difficult to track. Studone also serves as a simple task manager at its bare bones.
